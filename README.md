# How to get started

## Make sure you have the following dependencies installed
- docker
- docker compose
- make

## Make sure to have the dump.sql file
Already in the root of the project (but maybe the professor will change it)

## Initialize the database
```bash
make init
```

It will start the database and import the dump.sql file
